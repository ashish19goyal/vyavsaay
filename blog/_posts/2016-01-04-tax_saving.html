Vyavsaay.com provides Information Technology solutions to small and medium businesses. One of such businesses had a very peculiar requirement when they first contacted Vyavsaay. They wanted to have such a IT system that they could tweak to hide their tax liabilities. Our genuine reply was, "Its your information, you can do whatever you want to do with it."

<br>
Soon enough, we started getting such queries from more potential Vyavsaay users. It was time we come up with something concrete to satiate people's concerns. As we pondered over it, an old gentleman pointed out the crux of the issue to us. "They don't want to hide tax, they just want to save it. Since, they don't know how to save it, they go about hiding everything."
<br>

That was it. We got our answer. If we could help them know their exact tax liabilities as well as suggest them ways to reduce it, they would not need to hide it anymore. Instead, declaring all their business transactions will help hem earn better credit ratings with the banks/lenders and a better reputation in the market. The trust of partners and vendors will grow when they can determine that the businesses is doing good and reporting everything that they are doing.

<br>
So, we came up with these set of procedures and reports that can be used to track exact tax liabilities at any point of time during the financial year. Not only this, it segregates and points out the type of transactions that lead to a increase or decrease in the tax liability. There was one example where a business used to capture the tax payable when it sold something. However, it failed to capture the tax receivable when that item was returned or exchanged. When he added this to the sale and return procedure, he could save some of the tax.

It was a small saving for the business, but a significant win for us!!
