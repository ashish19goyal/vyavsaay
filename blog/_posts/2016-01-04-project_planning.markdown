As a business owner, when you first felt a need for a technology solution, there was a specific pain point that you must have felt. It could be anything ranging from stagnant sales to smarter competitors, or a bunch of new government regulations. To address this pain point, you started looking for a better technology solution. However, when you really went to the market and saw the different shiny new products, you slowly set aside your main objective (the pain point). Somehow, the marketers got you to focus more on the technology or the product, rather than the solution to your problem.

Mostly, the marketers don't care about your problem. They just want to sell their product or services. However, the first question that you should pose to the marketer is, 'How will this solve my problem?'. If the answer is not clear to you, try out another shop. Sometimes, they will tell you that they can solve your problem and then start showing of 10 other features of the product or service. Don't fall into this marketing trick. Follow the simple procedure as listed below:
<ul>
    <li>Prepare a list of problems that you want to address. </li>
    <li>Arrange the problems in a priority order. The most important at the top.</li>
    <li>If possible, assign a weight to every problem as per their importance for the continuity and growth of your business. (e.g. If an unsolved problem will lead to eventual closure of your business, assign it a high weight. If the problem is proving to be hindrance to growth, assign it a medium weight. If the problem causes only a short term sales loss, assign it a low weight.)</li>
    <li>Now, go to the market with this list.</li>
    <li>Present this list to the product/technology marketer and ask for the solutions to address them.</li>
    <li>For a solution to be worthy of selection, it should address all your high weighted problems.</li>
    <li>If multiple solutions can address your high weighted problems, choose the one that can also solve the medium weighted ones.</li>
    <li>Once you are sure about the solutions to the high and medium weighted problems, you can pick the shiniest or the best value for money solution.</li>
</ul>
<br>
If you haven't prepared such a list, go prepare it. Otherwise, every rupee invested will be money wasted. Eventually, you will have to go back to the market with some bitter experience.
